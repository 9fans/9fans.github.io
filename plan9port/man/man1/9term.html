<p><font size=+1><b>DESCRIPTION     </b></font><br>

<table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr height=2><td><tr><td width=20><td>

    <i>9term</i> is a terminal window program for the X Window System, providing
    an interface similar to that used on Plan 9.<br>
    <p><font size=+1><b>Command     </b></font><br>
    The <i>9term</i> command starts a new window. 
    <table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr height=5><td></table>
    
    The <tt><font size=+1>&#8722;a</font></tt> flag causes button 2 to send the selection immediately,
    like acme. Otherwise button 2 brings up a menu, described below.
    
    <table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr height=5><td></table>
    
    The <tt><font size=+1>&#8722;s</font></tt> option has no effect. It formerly set the scrolling mode,
    and is recognized to avoid breaking scripts that create new windows.
    See below for a description of scrolling behavior. 
    <table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr height=5><td></table>
    
    The <tt><font size=+1>&#8722;c</font></tt> option starts the window in forced cooked mode, described
    below. 
    <table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr height=5><td></table>
    
    The <i>font</i> argument to <tt><font size=+1>&#8722;f</font></tt> names a font used to display text, both
    in <i>9term</i>&#8217;s menus and as a default for any programs running in
    its windows; it also establishes the environment variable <tt><font size=+1>$font</font></tt>.
    If <tt><font size=+1>&#8722;f</font></tt> is not given, <i>9term</i> uses the imported value of <tt><font size=+1>$font</font></tt> if
    set; otherwise it uses the graphics system default. (See <a href="../man7/font.html"><i>font</i>(7)</a>
    for a full discussion of font
    syntaxes.) 
    <table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr height=5><td></table>
    
    <i>9term</i> runs the given command in the window, or <tt><font size=+1>$SHELL</font></tt> if no command
    is given.<br>
    <p><font size=+1><b>Text windows    </b></font><br>
    Characters typed on the keyboard collect in the window to form
    a long, continuous document. 
    <table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr height=5><td></table>
    
    There is always some <i>selected text</i>, a contiguous string marked
    on the screen by reversing its color. If the selected text is
    a null string, it is indicated by a hairline cursor between two
    characters. The selected text may be edited by mousing and typing.
    Text is selected by pointing and clicking button 1 to make a null-string
    selection, or by pointing, then
    sweeping with button 1 pressed. Text may also be selected by double-clicking:
    just inside a matched delimiter-pair with one of <tt><font size=+1>{[(&lt;`'&quot;</font></tt> on the
    left and <tt><font size=+1>}])&gt;`'&quot;</font></tt> on the right, it selects all text within the pair;
    at the beginning or end of a line, it selects the line; within
    or at the edge of an alphanumeric word, it selects the word. 
    <table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr height=5><td></table>
    
    Characters typed on the keyboard replace the selected text; if
    this text is not empty, it is placed in a <i>snarf buffer</i> common
    to all windows but distinct from that of <a href="../man1/sam.html"><i>sam</i>(1)</a>. 
    <table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr height=5><td></table>
    
    Programs access the text in the window at a single point maintained
    automatically by <i>9term</i>. The <i>output point</i> is the location in the
    text where the next character written by a program to the terminal
    will appear; afterwards, the output point is the null string beyond
    the new character. The output point is also the location in the
    text of the next character that
    will be read (directly from the text in the window, not from an
    intervening buffer) by a program. Since Unix does not make it
    possible to know when a program is reading the terminal, lines
    are sent as they are completed (when the user types a newline
    character). 
    <table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr height=5><td></table>
    
    In general there is text in the window after the output point,
    usually placed there by typing but occasionally by the editing
    operations described below. A pending read of the terminal will
    block until the text after the output point contains a newline,
    whereupon the read may acquire the text, up to and including the
    newline. After the read, as described
    above, the output point will be at the beginning of the next line
    of text. In normal circumstances, therefore, typed text is delivered
    to programs a line at a time. Changes made by typing or editing
    before the text is read will not be seen by the program reading
    it. Because of the Unix issues mentioned above, a line of text
    is only editable until it is
    completed with a newline character, or when hold mode (see below)
    is enabled. 
    <table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr height=5><td></table>
    
    Even when there are newlines in the output text, <i>9term</i> will not
    honor reads if the window is in <i>hold mode</i>, which is indicated
    by a white cursor and blue text and border. The ESC character
    toggles hold mode. Some programs automatically turn on hold mode
    to simplify the editing of multi-line text; type ESC when done
    to allow <i>mail</i> to read the text. 
    <table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr height=5><td></table>
    
    An EOT character (control-D) behaves exactly like newline except
    that it is not delivered to a program when read. Thus on an empty
    line an EOT serves to deliver an end-of-file indication: the read
    will return zero characters. The BS character (control-H) erases
    the character before the selected text. The ETB character (control-W)
    erases any
    nonalphanumeric characters, then the alphanumeric word just before
    the selected text. &#8216;Alphanumeric&#8217; here means non-blanks and non-punctuation.
    The NAK character (control-U) erases the text after the output
    point, and not yet read by a program, but not more than one line.
    All these characters are typed on the keyboard and hence replace
    the
    selected text; for example, typing a BS with a word selected places
    the word in the snarf buffer, removes it from the screen, and
    erases the character before the word. 
    <table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr height=5><td></table>
    
    An ACK character (control-F) or Insert character triggers file
    name completion for the preceding string (see <a href="../man3/complete.html"><i>complete</i>(3)</a>). 
    <table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr height=5><td></table>
    
    Text may be moved vertically within the window. A scroll bar on
    the left of the window shows in its clear portion what fragment
    of the total output text is visible on the screen, and in its
    grey part what is above or below view; it measures characters,
    not lines. Mousing inside the scroll bar moves text: clicking
    button 1 with the mouse pointing inside the
    scroll bar brings the line at the top of the window to the cursor&#8217;s
    vertical location; button 3 takes the line at the cursor to the
    top of the window; button 2, treating the scroll bar as a ruler,
    jumps to the indicated portion of the stored text. Holding a button
    pressed in the scroll bar will cause the text to scroll continuously
    until the button is released. 
    <table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr height=5><td></table>
    
    Typing down-arrow scrolls forward one third of a window, and up-arrow
    scrolls back. Typing page-down scrolls forward two thirds of a
    window, and page-up scrolls back. Typing Home scrolls to the top
    of the window; typing End scrolls to the end. 
    <table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr height=5><td></table>
    
    The DEL character sends an <tt><font size=+1>interrupt</font></tt> note to all processes in
    the window&#8217;s process group. Unlike the other characters, the DEL
    and arrow keys do not affect the selected text. The left (right)
    arrow key moves the selection to one character before (after)
    the current selection. 
    <table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr height=5><td></table>
    
    <i>9term</i> relies on the kernel&#8217;s terminal processing to handle EOT,
    so the terminal must be set up with EOT as the &#8220;eof&#8221; character.
    <i>9term</i> runs <i>stty</i>(1) to establish this when the terminal is created.
    
    <table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr height=5><td></table>
    
    <i>9term</i> always treats the DEL keystroke as an interrupt request.
    In response it sends the terminal&#8217;s current interrupt character
    (which need not be DEL). 
    <table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr height=5><td></table>
    
    Written output to a window is appended to the end of the window.
    The window scrolls to display the new output only if the end of
    the window was visible before the write. 
    <table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr height=5><td></table>
    
    <i>9term</i> changes behavior according to the terminal settings of the
    running programs. Most programs run with echo enabled. In this
    mode, <i>9term</i> displays and allows editing of the input. Some programs,
    typically those reading passwords, run with echo disabled. In
    this mode, <i>9term</i> passes keystrokes through directly, without echoing
    them or buffering
    until a newline character. These heuristics work well in many
    cases, but there are a few common ones where they fall short.
    First, programs using the GNU readline library typically disable
    terminal echo and perform echoing themselves. The most common
    example is the shell <i>bash</i>(1). Disabling the use of readline with
    &#8220;<tt><font size=+1>set +o emacs</font></tt>&#8221; [<i>sic</i>] usually
    restores the desired behavior. Second, remote terminal programs
    such as <i>ssh</i>(1) typically run with echo disabled, relying on the
    remote system to echo characters as desired. Plan 9&#8217;s <i>ssh</i> has
    a <tt><font size=+1>&#8722;C</font></tt> flag to disable this, leaving the terminal in &#8220;cooked&#8221; mode.
    For similar situations on Unix, <i>9term</i>&#8217;s button 2 menu has an entry
    to toggle the forced use of
    cooked mode, despite the terminal settings. In such cases, it
    is useful to run &#8220;<tt><font size=+1>stty &#8722;echo</font></tt>&#8221; on the remote system to avoid seeing
    your input twice. 
    <table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr height=5><td></table>
    
    Editing operations are selected from a menu on button 2. The <tt><font size=+1>cut</font></tt>
    operation deletes the selected text from the screen and puts it
    in the snarf buffer; <tt><font size=+1>snarf</font></tt> copies the selected text to the buffer
    without deleting it; <tt><font size=+1>paste</font></tt> replaces the selected text with the
    contents of the buffer; and <tt><font size=+1>send</font></tt> copies the snarf buffer to just
    after the output point, adding a final
    newline if missing. <tt><font size=+1>Paste</font></tt> will sometimes and <tt><font size=+1>send</font></tt> will always
    place text after the output point; the text so placed will behave
    exactly as described above. Therefore when pasting text containing
    newlines after the output point, it may be prudent to turn on
    hold mode first. 
    <table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr height=5><td></table>
    
    The <tt><font size=+1>plumb</font></tt> menu item sends the contents of the selection (not the
    snarf buffer) to the <i>plumber</i> (see <a href="../man1/plumb.html"><i>plumb</i>(1)</a>). If the selection
    is empty, it sends the white-space-delimited text containing the
    selection (typing cursor). A typical use of this feature is to
    tell the editor to find the source of an error by plumbing the
    file and line information in a compiler&#8217;s
    diagnostic.

    For systems without a three-button mouse, the keyboard modifier
    keys can be used to modify the effect of the main mouse button.
    On Unix systems, the Control key changes the main button to button
    2, and the Alt key changes it to button 3. On Mac systems, the
    Option key changes the main button to button 2, and the Command
    key changes it to
    button 3. Also on Mac systems, the usual keyboard shortcuts Command-C,
    -V, and -X invoke copy, paste, and cut, as in other programs.

    Each <i>9term</i> listens for connections on a Unix socket. When a client
    connects, the <i>9term</i> writes the window contents to the client and
    then hangs up. <i>9term</i> installs the name of this socket in the environment
    as <tt><font size=+1>$text9term</font></tt> before running <i>cmd</i>.<br>
