These fonts are converted from the BDFs in the XFree86 distribution.
They were all marked as public domain.

They're ugly, but support more languages than the standard fonts.
Mainly they're useful for scavenging.  ../lucm/unicode.9.font and
../pelm/unicode.9.font, for example, have been extended with glyphs
from here.
