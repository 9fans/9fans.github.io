desc='Plan 9 from User Space - binaries
 This package contains binaries for Plan 9 from User Space.
 Due to incompatibilities between the Linux 2.6+ thread library
 (NPTL) and the pre-2.6 Linux thread library (linuxthreads),
 different binaries must be used on the pre-2.6 systems than
 on 2.6 and later systems.
 .
 This package contains binaries for Linux 2.6 and later kernels.
